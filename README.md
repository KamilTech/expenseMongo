# Expensify-app with mongodb
This is a simple app where you will be able to note all your expenses and find out how much you have to spend in a certain period of time.

This is the same application like [here](https://github.com/KamilTech/Expensify-app) but this time I used Node.js(Express) with mongodb instead firebase.

## Getting started
To run this app on your local machine you have to install dependencies:
```
yarn run
```
Start locally mongodb

afterwards in root folder type:
```
yarn run dev-server
```
then: 
```
node server/server.js or nodemon server/server.js
```

And go to the localhost:8080
